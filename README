This skeleton directory has all the basics needed to start a new project:
	Project layout
	Automated tests
	Modules
	Install scripts


Using the Skeleton
1. Make project directory
2. Copy skeleton files to project directory
3. Rename everything with NAME to project or desired main module name
4. Edit setup.py for the project
5. Remove all *.pyc files to make sure it's clean before testing


Testing Guidlines
1. Name test files BLAH_tests.py
2. Write 1 test file for each module
3. Keep test cases (functions) short and clean. Avoid duplicate code with helper functions.
4. Sometimes delete tests and start over.


Suggested packages:
	pip, distribute/Setuptools, nose, virtualenv
